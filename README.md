## Group 08 - Head Coach

For this project, we are creating a fantasy football app that will tie into 
a custom web end that will simulate our own fantasy football season. 
The app will allow the user to make standard edits to their teams, potentially 
receiving suggestions generated through statistical analysis, as well as 
interacting with other users in their league (e.g.: making trades, 
sending messages, random insult generator, etc.), 
all of which will be supported by our web api.
